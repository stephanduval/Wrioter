## âœ… **COMPLETED TODAY (2025-07-02): NAVIGATION SYSTEM FIX**

### **ðŸ§­ Navigation Issues RESOLVED:**
1. **Fixed "Select Manuscript" button not responding to clicks**
   - Root cause: Component confusion - app uses `@layouts` system, not `VerticalNavMenu.vue`
   - Modified `VerticalNavLink.vue` to handle custom navigation items
   - Added permission bypass for custom items with `custom: true` flag
   - Successfully implemented click handler for manuscript selection drawer

2. **Enhanced Navigation Documentation**
   - Updated `docs/architecture/frontend.md` with navigation system details
   - Added clear warning about which components are actually used
   - Documented custom navigation item pattern for future development

### **ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:**
- **File Modified**: `/resources/ts/@layouts/components/VerticalNavLink.vue`
- **Key Change**: Added conditional logic for `custom` navigation items
- **Visual Debug**: Green background confirms component is working
- **Next Step**: User can now click "Select Manuscript" to trigger custom functionality

## ðŸ”„ **STATUS COMPLETE**

All navigation functionality is now working correctly. The "Select Manuscript" button is visible with visual debugging and responds to clicks with the custom handler.

## ðŸ“‹ **NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION**

- Navigation system is fully documented in `docs/architecture/frontend.md`
- Custom navigation pattern established and working
- No immediate blockers or issues pending
