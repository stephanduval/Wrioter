 Oh, the shadows we cast in twilight gloom, At the land that divides us, our hearts find no room. The stripes of discord, the fields of disdain, We March to the dissonance, a fractured refrain.

With no gleaming stars, just darkness above, No unity we find, no binding love. Where freedom falters, and justice bends, In this shattered land, our hope descends.

The flag of division,we unfurl high, A symbol of discord, where truth and trust die. No land of the free, no home of the brave, Only chains of discord, a nation enslaved."
