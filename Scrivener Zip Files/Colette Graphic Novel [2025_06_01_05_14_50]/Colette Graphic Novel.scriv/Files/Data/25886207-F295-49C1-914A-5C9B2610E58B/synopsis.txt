Date with that girl who I thought was an actress who worked in LA.  Turned out she was American.  Told me she never thought about having kids until she moved to Vancouver because it felt safer.

Then she told me everything that was wrong with me was exactly what was wrong with her last year and why was I dating-  if I'm going through this tough time - "what is in it for me- " she stopped herself - " for the people you are dating"

I listened to her some more "that's just my opinion " she said.  "Yeah but it comes at a cost you know,  the cost is asking me what I think and actually learning about what's going on and what I feel.  You can have an opinion and be wrong. But instead of asking you just were confidently wrong for the last five minutes about who I am.". 

What's in it for me?  So American.

OR MAYBE IT IS AT A PARTY

At a party 

" You know until we moved to Vancouver we weren't even going to have kids, but is so safe here...

The only thing that isn't perfect is that yoi Canadians are so passive-agressive"

"You know if i came from a place so messed up that just leaving it for another country made me reassess my major life choices I imagine I wouldn't be ao quick to criticize it"

Silence

Thought bubble 
"Goddamn"

"That WAS passive aggressive"

"Why are we like that?"
