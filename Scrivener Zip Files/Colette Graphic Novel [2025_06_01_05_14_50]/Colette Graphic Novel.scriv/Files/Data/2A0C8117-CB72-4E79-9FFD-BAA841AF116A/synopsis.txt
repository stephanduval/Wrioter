Madison and the c3w incident

Who gave ve you the power to evict me?  You never said a word back you just grabbed the biggest stick you could find.  Nevermind that I could never touch a stick that big to hit you. You smacked me like you owned that stick. The injustice of it.  Using something you did not build or earn to hurt someone as it it was yours.

Rather than keeping things on a level playing field.  I've never seen anything more American in my life

Americans have forgotten how to play fair.  They carry a gun because it's never been about fairness here. It's about who wins.

Unlike that British officer in Canada during the war of 1812 who when challenged to a duel by a renown gun fighter.  He had two options:  decline and pull rank and kick the man out of the army or accept and chose the distance of the fight.  Thd officer chose the distance of a handkerchief.   The gunfighter knowing they both would die withdrew from the fight and the army.  True bravery isn't entering a fight knowing you'll win.  And winning isn't worth anything if you win with someone else's army.
