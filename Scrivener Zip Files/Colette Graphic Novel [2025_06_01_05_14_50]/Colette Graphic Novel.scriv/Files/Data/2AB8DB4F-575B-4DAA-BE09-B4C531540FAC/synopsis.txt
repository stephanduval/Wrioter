Max going into the military after school.  I think he did engineering school or got a job.  He was drafted after he married Dodie but it was towards the end of the war.  He was put on the night shift on a base in California where he "learned a lot of new English words" swear words.  He didn't like it, he just did it. It was an obstacle.
