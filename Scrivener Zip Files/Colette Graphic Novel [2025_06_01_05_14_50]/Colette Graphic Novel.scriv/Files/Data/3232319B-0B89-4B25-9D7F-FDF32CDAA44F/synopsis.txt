Folks in C3W twitching and bothered from war trauma

-------------------
Us war crimes
 Soldiers entering homes and killing all fighting age males
Killing groups from the air without warning.

This was the civilized world teaching Afghanistanis a lesson for ... Doing literally nothing

Twenty years later they would be under the same dictatorship as before. With Twenty years of USA dictatorship and trauma in between. A generation.

These people did this.  Your neighbors
 The father's and mothers of your friends.
 
Don't be freaked out by that, but it should  make you deeply uncomfortable that for Twenty years these people can murder young men in their own homes and then go home and pretend like everything is fine with them.  That's a pretty universal fact outside the USA.
