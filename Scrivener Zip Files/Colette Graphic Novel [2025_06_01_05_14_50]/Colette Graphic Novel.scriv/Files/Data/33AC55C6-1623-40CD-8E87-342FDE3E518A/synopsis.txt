After the guy in the MC3 lab says "isn't Canada lucky to be living so close the the USA we let your economy grow"

"So are we supposed to be happy because you left a few scraps fall off your plate?"

Scene where the beaver is digging through a dumpster. His forest is now a city.  He finds a bag of trash " this will do fine"

Ad he begins to eat the words or letters he finds inside he looks at the camera "I don't feel so good". And throws up.

The words form the sentence.

"I refused to work to put food into other creatures bellies.  It's not my fault they are hungry."

Or 

"Hunger is often a problem that solves itself."
