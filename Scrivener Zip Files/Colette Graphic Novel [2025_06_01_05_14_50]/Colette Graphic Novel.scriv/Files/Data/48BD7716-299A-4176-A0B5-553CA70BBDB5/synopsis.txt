Jenica Denies Green Card


I wanted more time building forts with you.  More time chasing you around the yard. More time perfecting the burritos that you loved as a kid. The ones I would pack in my backpack and eat messily at the park. Or slightly less messily at the coffee shop

But I didn't get that time
 Because your mother took it from me
  Hoarded those moments like a dragon hoards gold.
  And then used a border to stop me from seeing my you.

America is not a place where people take care of each other.  Place where everyone tries to get what they want.  It's like a jar where a kid has put all the coolest bugs he can find and puts them into it.  Most of them ignore each other and some fight. But none of this is for their benefit.

The most confident and strongest win, but the best they can win is this sterile jar.  Your mom was so confident and happy the day she saw me off for Canada. After six months of cruelty and daily torture she acted like we were friends.  I was isolated for six months in the shit hole and when I was going is the first time she acted like we were family.

It was early in the morning and we were beside the front St. Market.  You were fascinating by an articulation crane that was loading a flat of material to the 6th floor of a building.  You kept pointing out the brightly lit and noisy crane to us.  You were and three months.

Your mom isn't really smart enough to see what she's done.  She's the queen of the bug jar.  But you can fly over the top, when you're old enough.  I hope to help you find out how.
