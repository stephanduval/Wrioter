So here's a description of what it is. Like, To experience. Uh the pain of not having colette full stop. It's not everyone is maternal or paternal like i am it's a kind of a weirder situation. Um, And uh, I guess i was describing to his young. What it is like.

To feel this way, and i guess,

Illustration is what i came up with this is the illustration. I came up with I feel like i have a Extra appendage like a octopus arm that sticks out of my body. And, You know, that purpose of that is to like reach out and hold collect. Or any child really?

But i guess i only realized it was there. When Colette was born now, That she's born. Has a purpose, it reaches that holds her, but if she's taken away from me, Then this thing is like, Searching for that person and the longer, it goes on without holding colette. The more.

Violently and randomly it. Thrashes until this. Appendage. Whips back and hits me. And now that's what it's doing. It's like it's it's getting frantic, it's freaking out and it's hurting me and it's constant, and it's like that. Is like where, like a natural part of your being can actually.

Become something that. It's more harmful than helpful.
