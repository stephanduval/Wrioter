Jenica becomes obsessed with the black holes paper; even though we have a business to start- whatever, this if fun for her. trying to figure it out.  I was more interested in practical stuff-  it will take so long to get it and you wont really understand it past a superficial level.  Jenica explains to me that the paper says that life might have started a few years after the big bang.  Life, or the component parts had already been created in that cataclysm- rather than billions or trillions of years after. maybe all the parts of our problems were there at the beginning too, It just wasn't something I knew to look for.
