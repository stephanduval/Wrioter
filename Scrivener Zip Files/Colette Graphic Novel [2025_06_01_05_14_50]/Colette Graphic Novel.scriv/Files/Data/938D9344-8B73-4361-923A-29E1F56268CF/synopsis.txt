You hear there was a shooting and you might be sad. But it's already done. It's basically statistics at this point it's in the past we should move on.  But I imagine how easy or hard it might have been to change that outcome. Where it that change might have taken place and weigh the odds of that and the effort against what was lost.  The lives that could have been lived together. the children that we might have watched grow up. The burden grows with each branch we trance into it's veiny possibilities.  

The unclaimed memories weigh on the Heart.

I spend too much time there but it always teaches me the same thing. It's better to fight for the good memories that could be and the people who might live than to settle for the comfort of quickly managed grief.
