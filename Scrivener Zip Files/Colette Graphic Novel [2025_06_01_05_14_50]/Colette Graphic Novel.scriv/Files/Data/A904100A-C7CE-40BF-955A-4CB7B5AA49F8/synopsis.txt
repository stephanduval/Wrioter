I used to wake up every morning dreading talking to Jenica.  "I want less of you (Jenica)". Are the words that immediately pop into my head each time I realize where I am.

Now the first words that in awake to are "Im tired of this". Or " this is not my life". Every morning it hits me like a punch to the gut.

My face is changing. I've gotten so old so quickly after being the guy who looked younger than he is.  I've gained weight. One by one my clothes no longer fit.

It's amazing how long you can deny something is happening when you're still fighting it.  This part of my life lasted from 13 April 2021 till now (8th July 2023).  Wow.  Two years of feeling like this.

These should have been the happiest, most wonderful times of my life.
