The parralel between my saying to Jenica "you don't get to be shocked every day eventually you have to accept it's going to happen unless you do something about it"

And every time I give Jenica the opportunity to accept the green card
" You're always shocked that she goes so low every time, why are you always surprised and it puts you into a spiral each time"

"I just don't expect her to condemn her daughter to this life each time.  Hope works like that"
