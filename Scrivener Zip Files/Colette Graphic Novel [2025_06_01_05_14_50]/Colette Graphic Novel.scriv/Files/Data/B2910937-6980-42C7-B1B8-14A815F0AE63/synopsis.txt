Matt lane told me that having a kid in the states was a terrible idea.  He was right.

But hes an asshole. And his dream was to have his shitty sci Fi novel published. So if he reads this its because he bought this in a store.  So at least i know he'll be seething with jealousy. Because the man is never happy for anyone
