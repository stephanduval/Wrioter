My friends have told me that I've always wanted to have kids...

Is there a way to tell this story without breaking your heart?

I can't be there with you whether you need me or not.  But at least I can stop myself from putting anything out there that will make you feel pain.  It's the ony option I've been given to be a good part of your life. 

When I was a teenager I was put on anti-depressants briefly.  The Dr,  Dr. Muzuka asked me what my initial impression of the drugs were.

I didn't feel sad anymore.  The river of sorrow that seemed to soak into everything in my life and made it just shit was gone.  But in its place was nothing.  I felt nothing.  I realized that even the sorrow and sadness somehow helped me feel connected to the world.  If that was all I felt, at lest I FELT it. My experience of life, happy or sad, was better as an experience.  

I wonder what you will choose, if you will reflect on this choice I made to write it all out.  Will you be content to feel or will you wish you had never turned these pages?  

I find in life, with time, we seldomly regret our experience, it becomes us.  And if we are even remotely happy we are glad for that exprience, the good and the bad ones.  

It doesn't really matter how I feel about it now, because one day that will change.  And then I won't remember my life before all this.  And just for that reason I will love even this sorrow that formed who I am.  This uncessary, abusurd and abundant sorrow.
