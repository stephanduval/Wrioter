When Jenica and I started planning to have Colette I told her that my greatest fear was to be working so much that I never got to spend meaningful time with my children.  I even changed careers and took a massive pay cut so that I could work from home and be closer to Colette during her young years.

Now I don't make enough to simply spend the time that I want to in the USA.  The more time I spend and the cost of travel and hotels make it impossible financially to spend time with Colette and support her financially. 

It's a form of torture to have to work a job don't like you chose to have more time with your child and not be able to see them.  There is a border and an interactable financial problem that prevents me from being a part of Colette's life.  To send what little money I make to raise a child that I'm prevented from seeing is a kind of slavery.


Even in the tech world Americans love slavery. If you have an HB-1 visa it's tied to your job.  Lose your job and you have to leave the country in 60 days.  Americans love the idea of your existence being tied to your productivity.
