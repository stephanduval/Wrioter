Neighbour David and the narrator are sitting on Mt.

It’s not fair to write about you, is it neighbour David?

“Not really”

It’s because you’re dead, isn’t it?

“Yeah, that’s a bit inconvenient for you”  

For both of us.

“Let me ask you a question”

...

“What are you trying to get out of all of this?”

Closure, I guess.  This was a traumatic experience for me.

“Why was it traumatic?”

I had my daughter taken away from me.  I think a big part of it was that I reacted badly.  But that doesn’t make it right.

“Is there another way to look at this situation? Is it so bad? It seems to me that you’ve been unhappy for so long. Maybe you brought some of that unhappiness with you”

Sure. We all have baggage.


“If you could do anything right now, what would you do”

I don’t know. I guess just be with Colette be her father

“Anything else, what else would you do?”

I don’t really have a plan B, everything kind of orbits around her right now.  Do you think that’s healthy?

“What would I know about healthy?  I’m dead”

That sucks.

“You know you’re just talking to yourself”

I know.

“I forgive you”
