Jehanne, you are my rock.  I would not be writing right now if it were not for you.  Thank you my love.  You're my muse, my inspiration and a wellspring of joy and laughter in my life.

I wish you were awake right now because I want to kiss you.  Also because have to pee.  But you are sleeping in the aisle seat and I love watching you be so peaceful.
