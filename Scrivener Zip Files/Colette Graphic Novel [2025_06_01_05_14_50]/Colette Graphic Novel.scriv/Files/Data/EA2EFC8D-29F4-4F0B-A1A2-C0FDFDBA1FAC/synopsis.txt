When youre dating at a mature level its not just about impressing someone. Youre trying to see if you're compatible.  You are talking about your good traits and your flaws.  Realizing you're not compatible early on can be just succesful as realizing you are.  

For instance I find it hard to set a work life balance.   I cant fit duvet covers well.  You have to be honest with them because if you date your issues eill become their issues.  Ill struggle with that duvet cover every two weeks until I fix it or not. And ill have to slide my whole body in there to get it to fit right, and when im in there ill probably have to chase you around the house like dime floral print ghost
