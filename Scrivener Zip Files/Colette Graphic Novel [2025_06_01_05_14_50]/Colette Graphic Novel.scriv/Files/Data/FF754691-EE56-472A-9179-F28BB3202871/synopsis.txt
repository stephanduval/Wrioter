WHERE I WAS, WHO I WAS, What my dreams where. What I believed would be the most stable way to raise a child; cynicism about divorce rates and weather love creates  stable environment for raising a child or all that passion, when we lose it, we use that to attack each other; in our newfound emptyness we seek to hurt the other person rather than seeing the higher purpose of caring for the child.   I was wrong about that, but we are allowed to be wrong at some times.
