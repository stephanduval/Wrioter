            <Title>Revenants</Title>
            <Synopsis>
Tell this story in the graphic novel but it's a monkey on a ladder to look above the crowd and a giraffe leans in (are they native to west Africa?) And whispers &quot;you know we don't really believe in this)

You aren't supposed to photograph them.   And if they touch you, you die.  Everyone knows that and respects it.

That made it hard for me. At the time I wanted to photograph everything.

The sharp warping pitch of the talking drum pinged over the crowd in the square where the town's biggest and oldest Baobab stood.  Every exit was blocked and I was happy to watch from the sloped dirt bank next to a cinder block wall that let me stand slightly higher than the crowd. Kids hugged their parents legs beside me while their older brothers ran in between the people who crowded along the fringes of the alleyway.  

The Six or seven drummers gathered under the shade of the Baobab had a steady beat.  Just a group of Vodun drummers that came into town to put on a show and make some money under the watchful and unconcerned eye of a local adobe mosque.  No one wrings hands about the scholarly conflict between Muhammad and the revenants- ghosts- that these drummers have summoned up. These shows are something else man.  Its taken me decades and I still remember every detail.

Boom, the revenants hips swish suddenly and impossibly up, his arms thrown back swaying the guile suit's grass and cloth folds. Dust comes off the ghost.  It's fabric at once bright and dirty, as old as its own constitution would allow.  The person it has chosen to inhabit for the time must be a damn good dancer and is no doubt sweating under the layers of brightly coloured West African harlequin.  His face stares you down with it's severe mesh of black and white vertical lines. 

A slight break in the drum beat and the Revenant surges forward-  he stops dancing and starts to charge the crowd madly.  Chaos on that side of the street abrupts as the children scream in terror and joy.  A serious looking drummer jumps to his feet and chases the wild Revenant down, bringing him back under control with a more specific beat.  He coaxes the ghost back to the drumming ring where two more ghosts are dancing madly, beautifully.  The crowd is loving it.  Business is on hold as more people trickle toward the wall- shoulder to shoulder- and nearby fences as they get a better look.

I'm getting looks too- wary backward looks from the individuals who are unlucky enough to be bored of their less than ideal view.  Even with this crazy and imminent ghost-touch-death on the line being white will get you some curious stares from the kids and a few adults.  

I decide to cross the street to the fence improve my view as well.  I step down to street level and lose sight of the action behind the wall of onlookers.  But the crowd is breaking  everyone rushes for the walls and store fronts bordering the street while the kids bolt straight down the red dust road. The red revenant- the one with the bead curtain for a face has gotten loose and starts charging into the crowd- running of the bulls style.  People run like death is on the line.  

I kind of feel a little apart from this whole show.  I'm the foreigner. This running shit isn't for me.  I'll just walk out of the way slowly because this part- this is for the kids right?  Those kids are FAST. wow. Oh he's close, okay I'll do this little half-run... just so I don't get in the way of the show. But bead face is still coming down the street and he seems to have focused on me oh shit oh shit oh shit.  I'm at full fucking sprint now.

Everyone starts laughing.  The kids standing on the berms forming a crowd on either side of the street, the adults who are reforming the human wall along the square think this is hilarious.  Fucking everyone.

Lucky for me there was this old dude standing in the middle of the street.  The kind of old where just sitting down and getting up is a big deal.  When I run past him the Revenant stops, gives a little respectful gesture and runs back towards the Baobab.    It kind of breaks the third wall of the ghost act when the ghost bows to grandpa, but respect for elders runs deep here.  

The heat of running was nothing like the heat of embarrassment.  

Once all this settles down and the crowd is focused back on the square, a man approaches me.  He's about 40ish to my 18. He's got the vibe of someone who has been lucky enough to travel to Europe in the past and maybe has a few of the sour memories of being looked down on there. He says to me in French.

&quot;You know, we don't really believe that's a ghost inside there, I want you to know that.&quot;   I nod.  &quot;It's just a lot of fun.&quot;

That moment suck with me for a while.  I don't know why he told me that but I'm glad he did.  It left a lot of questions but also a lot of dimensions to that experience.

Did he think I looked down on him?  Was he worried I would leave there and start telling stories about these &quot;silly Fon people&quot; or was he simply trying to reassure me that there was no harm meant in this traditional faith that had stood the test of time between strict Christianity and monotheism obsessed Islam?

Lately I've been thinking about all of these practical superstitions we have in our daily lives.  In a pandemic we have new superstitions.  Social distancing.  Wearing masks and the degrees of belief we have in them.  Trying to make sense of the charts and numbers and distilling them into different degrees of fear, reverence and bravado.

Someone in a position to transmit the virus to me very patiently explained that they don't believe in the mainstream media and that the science behind mask wearing was suspect.  Anti mask superstition is powerful and real and it's killing people. I'm watching this pernicious ideology in horror as the cases grow where I live. I'm worrying about my one month old daughter and... lately I'm remembering that guy in the road off the square in Allada, Benin.

I wish someone here would tell me now &quot;It's not that we don't really believe masks are useless. The anti-mask thing is just a silly story to keep people watching the news, It's all a big joke and no one takes the position seriously.  But we value the story more than we are bothered by the dissonance.&quot;  That would help put everything in perspective.  But the Covid-19 numbers keep rising. 

I managed to sneak a photo. At a funeral where the drummers and dancers performed a more muted show.  </Synopsis>

            <Synopsis>I didn't know where to take you.  My options were so limited. But you made it very clear to me.  You wanted to go to the carousel at Dragon's Hollow. I think it was the first time I had ever taken you there, and it was </Synopsis>
            <Text>Erin Richard’s (maiden name Stevns) kids kids were attending a birthday at Dragon’s Hollow.  I met her there with you. She was drinking wine out of her purse.  A bit strange but honestly I needed a friend at the time.  She picked you up and held you which was both scary and wonderful.  She was going to provide a safe harbour for our family.

You made it very clear to me.  You wanted to go to the carousel at Dragon's Hollow. I think it was the first time I had ever taken you there.  I was still cynical about these things.  It seemed like a nostalgic thing, or a money grab from the outside.  
The carousel is beautiful.  It is all wooden hand carved parts with beautiful hand painted wooden Horses of all different types.  Hand painted frescos of the people who funded and volunteered to build the thing.  Big gears turned and the whole thing was a little tuned down. Low key.

You always wanted the “Mermaid Horse” the one with the armor scales painted on. I guess you thought it looked like a fish.   
I held on to you in front of me while you grabbed the pole.  We went up and down with the turn of the giant mechanical wheel and all the cogs that made the whole thing go.  Your hair was soft and fine and getting wild.  You felt so tiny in my arms and yet so big at the same time.  You were getting bigger each time I saw you.  Then, at once magical moment you turned to me and said “daddy, I love you.”   It still remains one of the happiest moments of my life.  Of

The next time you wanted the Dragon Horse.
 I was so proud when I found that you could sit on the horse all by yourself.  I was so nervous strapping you with just that long leather belt. The kind old man who works there was nice enough to show me how to double loop the belt so that you could be held in.  

I rode beside you, with my hand inches from your back.  I was so proud of you for being so brave and confident.  I was a little sad that perhaps this was not your first time on the carousel but those thoughts don’t linger long when I’m around you.  I loved these moments, watching you while the world blurred around.  It’s us, in our bubble, It’s you experiencing a thrill. It’s one of my favourite memories of you.

Of course your favourite horse after that was always “paint” it was a rainbow coloured horse with green spots and a bright yellow mane.

            <Title>BEAVER AND EAGLE</Title>
            <Synopsis>
We hold these truths to be self evident
That every parent has an inalienable right to access to their child and that every child has an inalienable right to their parent regardless of economic status, nationality or language.*

*Exceptions would be very specific circumstances.*

Image of an eagle on top of a tree, at the very bottom of the page the tree extends and it's being gnawed by a beaver.

Eagle asks. Why did you fell my tree?  
Beaver the tree is mine. It's Domain is the Earth and the water that's where I live.  Eagle: but it's useful to me.  Beaver (still working) why? Because from the tree I can see other things I plan to claim for my own.  
Beaver but your domain is the sky. You take things because they are there and it's convenient, but you can see much more than you can ever use.  It's not right for you to decide who does what with the things that touch their homes.

The eyes can always want more than the body can use.

Eagle: That sounds like socialism. If I can take it then I should. If I worked the hardest for it then I should get it.

Beaver: Well I would have to work very hard to be able to fly around and claim what my will desired.  These rules don't suit me.

Eagle: They don't have to. 

Beaver: you're starting to sound like an empire. 

Eagle: Empires are intentional. This is the triumph of whim, opportunity and luck.  I shan't be held accountable. I didn't ask for this.  

Beaver: Sounds like we are cooking the meal and paying the bill.

Eagle: It isn't our fault if the food was already prepared and served. We never expected to be so hungry.  

Beaver: Everything gets hungry, we can always expect ourselves to be hungry, and from that experience we can imagine that other creatures get hungry too.  Hundreds of hungry creatures in this forest and if our needs must be met then it's obvious that they needs must be met too.

Eagle:  I refused to work to put food into other creatures bellies.  It's not my fault they are hungry.

Beaver: Hunger is the default. It's inevitable.

Eagles: Hunger is often a problem that solves itself.

(Flies away)


Beaver:  Some day you will get hungry and eat all of the words you just said.

Date with that girl who I thought was an actress who worked in LA.  Turned out she was American.  Told me she never thought about having kids until she moved to Vancouver because it felt safer.

Then she told me everything that was wrong with me was exactly what was wrong with her last year and why was I dating-  if I'm going through this tough time - &quot;what is in it for me- &quot; she stopped herself - &quot; for the people you are dating&quot;

I listened to her some more &quot;that's just my opinion &quot; she said.  &quot;Yeah but it comes at a cost you know,  the cost is asking me what I think and actually learning about what's going on and what I feel.  You can have an opinion and be wrong. But instead of asking you just were confidently wrong for the last five minutes about who I am.&quot;. 

What's in it for me?  So American.

OR MAYBE IT IS AT A PARTY

At a party 

&quot; You know until we moved to Vancouver we weren't even going to have kids, but is so safe here...

The only thing that isn't perfect is that yoi Canadians are so passive-agressive&quot;

Madison and the c3w incident

Who gave ve you the power to evict me?  You never said a word back you just grabbed the biggest stick you could find.  Nevermind that I could never touch a stick that big to hit you. You smacked me like you owned that stick. The injustice of it.  Using something you did not build or earn to hurt someone as it it was yours.

Rather than keeping things on a level playing field.  I've never seen anything more American in my life

Americans have forgotten how to play fair.  They carry a gun because it's never been about fairness here. It's about who wins.

Unlike that British officer in Canada during the war of 1812 who when challenged to a duel by a renown gun fighter.  He had two options:  decline and pull rank and kick the man out of the army or accept and chose the distance of the fight.  Thd officer chose the distance of a handkerchief.   The gunfighter knowing they both would die withdrew from the fight and the army.  True bravery isn't entering a fight knowing you'll win.  And winning isn't worth anything if you win with someone else's army.  </Synopsis>

            <Title>GREEN CARD</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jenica Denies Green Card


I wanted more time building forts with you.  More time chasing you around the yard. More time perfecting the burritos that you loved as a kid. The ones I would pack in my backpack and eat messily at the park. Or slightly less messily at the coffee shop

But I didn't get that time
 Because your mother took it from me
  Hoarded those moments like a dragon hoards gold.
  And then used a border to stop me from seeing my you.
---------

America is not a place where people take care of each other.  Place where everyone tries to get what they want.  It's like a jar where a kid has put all the coolest bugs he can find and puts them into it.  Most of them ignore each other and some fight. But none of this is for their benefit.

The most confident and strongest win, but the best they can win is this sterile jar.  Your mom was so confident and happy the day she saw me off for Canada. After six months of cruelty and daily torture she acted like we were friends.  I was isolated for six months in the shit hole and when I was going is the first time she acted like we were family.

It was early in the morning and we were beside the front St. Market.  You were fascinating by an articulation crane that was loading a flat of material to the 6th floor of a building.  You kept pointing out the brightly lit and noisy crane to us.  You were and three months.

Your mom isn't really smart enough to see what she's done.  She's the queen of the bug jar.  But you can fly over the top, when you're old enough.  I hope to help you find out how.</Synopsis>

            <Title>I want this not to be my life</Title>
            <Synopsis>
I wake up every morning dreading talking to Jenica.  &quot;I want less of you (Jenica)&quot;. Are the words that immediately pop into my head each time I realize where I am.

Now the first words that in awake to are &quot;Im tired of this&quot;. Or &quot; this is not my life&quot;. Every morning it hits me like a punch to the gut.

My face is changing. I've gotten so old so quickly after being the guy who looked younger than he is.  I've gained weight. One by one my clothes no longer fit.

It's amazing how long you can deny something is happening when you're still fighting it.  This part of my life lasted from 13 April 2021 till now (8th July 2023).  Wow.  Two years of feeling like this.

These should have been the happiest, most wonderful times of my life.

I want to write to Jenica

Dear narcissist,

It's time to acknowledge what is going on here.  I know it won't maken a difference in the substance of our communication but I will be less of a burden on me to stop pretending that you are anything other than someone who acts out of your own short term interest.

It is no comfort to me to accept that one day Colette will navigate around you the way most adults who truly understand you navigate around you.  With a mixture of love and pity, but without trust or the ability to truly connect with you. Because to connect with someone you have to be able to emphasize with them and you simply can't do that.  One day Colette will grow to love you the way you love your mother.  The biological requirement of love will always work against the sense of reluctance and resentment that you feel.

It's no comfort knowing that, being older parents this phase where Colette realizes what you did to her will last for a minority of your life.  You won't truly have to experience the impact of her understanding what you are.  In fact, because of what you've done I'll miss the majority of her life, no matter what I do.

You've done this.  You knew that my greatest fear before becoming a parent was that I would be working too much to be a part my child's life.  I adjusted so much of my life to be a significant part of my future child's life even before meeting you, and somehow you managed to make it so that I will see my daughter less than I saw my father.

Somehow you managed to recreate the same distant and strained relationship you have with your father.

            <Synopsis>#Colette 
#GraphicNovel 

Tell this story in the graphic novel but it's a monkey on a ladder to look above the crowd and a giraffe leans in (are they native to west Africa?) And whispers &quot;you know we don't really believe in this)

You aren't supposed to photograph them.   And if they touch you, you die.  Everyone knows that and respects it.

That made it hard for me. At the time I wanted to photograph everything.

The sharp warping pitch of the talking drum pinged over the crowd in the square where the town's biggest and oldest Baobab stood.  Every exit was blocked and I was happy to watch from the sloped dirt bank next to a cinder block wall that let me stand slightly higher than the crowd. Kids hugged their parents legs beside me while their older brothers ran in between the people who crowded along the fringes of the alleyway.  

The Six or seven drummers gathered under the shade of the Baobab had a steady beat.  Just a group of Vodun drummers that came into town to put on a show and make some money under the watchful and unconcerned eye of a local adobe mosque.  No one wrings hands about the scholarly conflict between Muhammad and the revenants- ghosts- that these drummers have summoned up. These shows are something else man.  Its taken me decades and I still remember every detail.

Boom, the revenants hips swish suddenly and impossibly up, his arms thrown back swaying the guile suit's grass and cloth folds. Dust comes off the ghost.  It's fabric at once bright and dirty, as old as its own constitution would allow.  The person it has chosen to inhabit for the time must be a damn good dancer and is no doubt sweating under the layers of brightly coloured West African harlequin.  His face stares you down with it's severe mesh of black and white vertical lines. 

A slight break in the drum beat and the Revenant surges forward-  he stops dancing and starts to charge the crowd madly.  Chaos on that side of the street abrupts as the children scream in terror and joy.  A serious looking drummer jumps to his feet and chases the wild Revenant down, bringing him back under control with a more specific beat.  He coaxes the ghost back to the drumming ring where two more ghosts are dancing madly, beautifully.  The crowd is loving it.  Business is on hold as more people trickle toward the wall- shoulder to shoulder- and nearby fences as they get a better look.

I'm getting looks too- wary backward looks from the individuals who are unlucky enough to be bored of their less than ideal view.  Even with this crazy and imminent ghost-touch-death on the line being white will get you some curious stares from the kids and a few adults.  

I decide to cross the street to the fence improve my view as well.  I step down to street level and lose sight of the action behind the wall of onlookers.  But the crowd is breaking  everyone rushes for the walls and store fronts bordering the street while the kids bolt straight down the red dust road. The red revenant- the one with the bead curtain for a face has gotten loose and starts charging into the crowd- running of the bulls style.  People run like death is on the line.  

I kind of feel a little apart from this whole show.  I'm the foreigner. This running shit isn't for me.  I'll just walk out of the way slowly because this part- this is for the kids right?  Those kids are FAST. wow. Oh he's close, okay I'll do this little half-run... just so I don't get in the way of the show. But bead face is still coming down the street and he seems to have focused on me oh shit oh shit oh shit.  I'm at full fucking sprint now.

Everyone starts laughing.  The kids standing on the berms forming a crowd on either side of the street, the adults who are reforming the human wall along the square think this is hilarious.  Fucking everyone.

Lucky for me there was this old dude standing in the middle of the street.  The kind of old where just sitting down and getting up is a big deal.  When I run past him the Revenant stops, gives a little respectful gesture and runs back towards the Baobab.    It kind of breaks the third wall of the ghost act when the ghost bows to grandpa, but respect for elders runs deep here.  

The heat of running was nothing like the heat of embarrassment.  

Once all this settles down and the crowd is focused back on the square, a man approaches me.  He's about 40ish to my 18. He's got the vibe of someone who has been lucky enough to travel to Europe in the past and maybe has a few of the sour memories of being looked down on there. He says to me in French.

&quot;You know, we don't really believe that's a ghost inside there, I want you to know that.&quot;   I nod.  &quot;It's just a lot of fun.&quot;

That moment suck with me for a while.  I don't know why he told me that but I'm glad he did.  It left a lot of questions but also a lot of dimensions to that experience.

Did he think I looked down on him?  Was he worried I would leave there and start telling stories about these &quot;silly Fon people&quot; or was he simply trying to reassure me that there was no harm meant in this traditional faith that had stood the test of time between strict Christianity and monotheism obsessed Islam?

Lately I've been thinking about all of these practical superstitions we have in our daily lives.  In a pandemic we have new superstitions.  Social distancing.  Wearing masks and the degrees of belief we have in them.  Trying to make sense of the charts and numbers and distilling them into different degrees of fear, reverence and bravado.

Someone in a position to transmit the virus to me very patiently explained that they don't believe in the mainstream media and that the science behind mask wearing was suspect.  Anti mask superstition is powerful and real and it's killing people. I'm watching this pernicious ideology in horror as the cases grow where I live. I'm worrying about my one month old daughter and... lately I'm remembering that guy in the road off the square in Allada, Benin.

I wish someone here would tell me now &quot;It's not that we don't really believe masks are useless. The anti-mask thing is just a silly story to keep people watching the news, It's all a big joke and no one takes the position seriously.  But we value the story more than we are bothered by the dissonance.&quot;  That would help put everything in perspective.  But the Covid-19 numbers keep rising. 

I managed to sneak a photo. At a funeral where the drummers and dancers performed a more muted show.

            <Title>Make up Colette</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jenica doing &quot;Beauty days&quot; with Colette,

Are the patterns repeating?
&quot;Why do you put on make-up&quot;?

Asked the pirate

&quot; To look beautiful&quot; said Colette

&quot;&lt;&lt;What is beautiful?&quot;&gt;&gt;Asked the pirate

Now that's a silly question.

&quot;A flower is beautiful&quot;

So you look a flower?

No!  I look like me 

If you look like you then why cover your face?  So a flower isn't beautiful is it? Beauty is something else.  Why do we call a flower beautiful?

&quot;Because a flower reminds us of something beautiful.&quot; She was getting tired of the pirate now, and the make up felt hot and sticky under the sun.


A flower reflects beauty, like a puddle reflects the sun, even though water isn't the sun?  Is there water in the sun?

No...

The more the sun shines the smaller the puddle gets?  Just like the more make-up you wear the less of your facei see,?

So Beauty isn't in a flower. Or make up. Or the sun. So what?

Make up reminds us of beauty, even if it covers us up, but  we don't see Beauty when we look at a stick of makeup.  

How does it make you feel?  

Confident.  Hot. A little.

Maybe you feel confident because it takes something away from you.  It takes away your comfort in your own skin.  

The roughe felt rough under the sun.

What does the truth wear?

Nothing is can't wear clothes.  It's not a thing.   

Then why does beauty need make up?

Suddenly Colette felt something she didn't realize she felt, she felt confident because she was avoiding another new feeling.

&quot;Shame&quot;. 

Shame?  Asked the pirate

I feel the absence of shame.  I feel embarrassed when I don't have the make up.  

Hiding part of the time made her feel like she should be hiding all of the time. Like covering the plain and imperfect parts of her face made her feel like her face should be covered all the time.

She was running from embarassment and feeding it more each day.

The truth is naked and Shane wears eyeliner....

That's what I think. 

The more I put on make-up the less of me there is.  Beauty isn't in a jar or a can,it just reminds us that some beautiful things have bright colours or smooth surfaces.  But some beautiful things are rough, patchy and have zits.  

She was hiding her face because the less she saw of it the more she was embarrassed of what little she saw.

The pirate let her wipe off the foundation on his handkerchief she felt naked and normal.  Even a little bit beautiful.</Synopsis>

To feel this way, and i guess,

Illustration is what i came up with this is the illustration. I came up with I feel like i have a Extra appendage like a octopus arm that sticks out of my body. And, You know, that purpose of that is to like reach out and hold collect. Or any child really?

But i guess i only realized it was there. When Colette was born now, That she's born. Has a purpose, it reaches that holds her, but if she's taken away from me, Then this thing is like, Searching for that person and the longer, it goes on without holding colette. The more.

Violently and randomly it. Thrashes until this. Appendage. Whips back and hits me. And now that's what it's doing. It's like it's it's getting frantic, it's freaking out and it's hurting me and it's constant, and it's like that. Is like where, like a natural part of your being can actually.

Become something that. It's more harmful than helpful.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Afghanistan 9/11 bar fight scene</Title>
            <Text>

AMERICA is sitting at the bar, minding his own business.  

A raucous group is sitting at a table behind them. Afghanistan, a bottle gets thrown, hits the bar.

The bottle hits the counter and a piece of glass hits America in the EYE!

Oh shit, the whole world comes around in sympathy.  “I’ll call an ambulance, stay calm”

USA rages, gets up and starts smashing the table, the group starts fighting. The crowd is watching.  USA “Give me that guy. No negotiations” A guy (Taliban) says- “ok ok, wait, can you prove it was this guy”?
 USA &quot;When I said no negotiations, I meant no negotiations.&quot;  He starts to beat up everyone, except one guy “I’m on your side”

USA: “Are you with me?”

CANADA, AUSTRALIA, BRITAIN, Yes,
Rest of NATO. Sure, but can we have a plan for this?

World:  “This is going to be a mess”  Can someone talk to him?   Ok lets make a plan to fix this after it’s over.

USA “I’m just getting started”

IRAQ “Shit he’s after me”

Everyone’s out now but Britain and Australia.  “Don’t forget Poland”

What’s going on here?

Guys stop, this isn’t right.  This war is Illegal.  The U.S. sought a second United Nations Security Council resolution to authorize military action against Iraq 

USA: “CUBA, hold these guys for me”  
CUBA jesus.

“What the fuck America” slow your roll”

USA leaves pakistan with a black eye,  “jesus man”

The whole bar is a mess, everyone is ashen.

Afghanistan table is asking “Hey man, can you help us fix the table?”

America grabbing whiskey from the bar “I’m off guys, great night, I built a better bar at my house anyway.”

ABC NEWS 14OCT2001

NATO officially joined the war effort in Afghanistan on October 4, 2001, when the organization invoked Article 5 of the NATO treaty for the first time in its history. 

November 13, 2001: The city of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, fell to forces belonging to the Northern Alliance. This marked a significant step in the U.S.-led coalition's efforts to remove the Taliban from power. 

United Nations Security Council resolution 1378, adopted unanimously on 14 November 2001, after reaffirming all resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan, including resolutions 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000) and 1363 (2001), the Council affirmed that the United Nations would play an important role in the country and called for the establishment of a transitional administration leading to the formation of a new government.[1] 

&quot;There's no discussions. I've told them what they need to do,&quot; Bush said today, hammering away at the same theme he has often repeated over the last month. &quot;When I said no negotiations, I meant no negotiations.&quot;

THE CHAT GPT version:
Certainly! Here's a playful narrative of the events of 9/11 and the subsequent response, personified as if the USA and the involved countries were people having a conversation at a bar:
USA: Hey everyone, gather around. So, I was just minding my own business on September 11, 2001, when these terrorists flew planes into the Twin Towers in New York City. It was a shocker, let me tell you.
UK: Oh my, that's terrible! Are you okay?
USA: Not really, mate. I was furious. Those were my iconic skyscrapers! Anyway, I called my buddy NATO to back me up, and we all agreed that this was an attack on all of us.
NATO: Yeah, we couldn't let that slide. Article 5, remember? An attack on one is an attack on all. We're in this together.
Canada: Count me in too! We've got your back.
France: Absolutely, mon ami. Terrorism is a threat to all of us. We'll stand united.
Germany: Agreed, we can't let these acts of violence go unpunished.
USA: Thanks, pals. So, we put our heads together and went after the Taliban in Afghanistan, where those Al-Qaeda terrorists were hiding. Operation Enduring Freedom, they called it. We kicked down their doors and said, &quot;No more hiding, you're done!&quot;
Afghanistan: Wait a minute, I didn't sign up for this chaos. You came in guns blazing and turned everything upside down!
USA: Sorry, Afghanistan, we had to get the bad guys. But don't worry, we'll help you rebuild and find some stability.
Iraq: Hey, don't forget about me! You thought I had weapons of mass destruction, but I didn't. Next thing I know, you're invading my space. Not cool.
USA: Oops, my bad. Sorry, Iraq. That was a mix-up. But hey, we're here now, so let's try to sort things out.
International Community: Whoa, hold up! This is causing a lot of tension. We're worried about the collateral damage, civilian casualties, and the rise of insurgency.
USA: Yeah, it got a bit messy, but we're trying to help Iraq find its footing again.
World: Well, you better figure it out. This is causing ripples everywhere.
USA: Got it. We're working on it. But hey, let's not forget, we've made progress against Al-Qaeda. We got Osama bin Laden!
Pakistan: Yeah, but you didn't tell me you were coming over. It's complicated, you know?
USA: Sorry, Pakistan. We just wanted to be thorough. We're all in this together against terrorism.
World: Okay, just remember, diplomacy and cooperation are key.
USA: You're right. We'll try to mend fences and promote peace. We've all learned some lessons through this.
Afghanistan: Yeah, and don't forget about me. I need some help rebuilding after all of this!
USA: Absolutely, Afghanistan. We're committed to helping you get back on your feet.
World: Let's raise a toast to a safer and more united future. May we learn from the past and build a better world together!
Cheers! 🍻

With the USA as a convesation at a bar

Sure, here's a narrative with a different tone, reflecting a less favorable portrayal of the U.S. and including mention of the use of torture:
USA: Hey folks, gather 'round. So, on September 11, 2001, some planes crashed into my buildings. Pretty messed up, right?
UK: Oh my, are you alright?
USA: I mean, it was my towers that got hit. But you know me, I never let things slide. I started waving the big stick and called it a &quot;War on Terror.&quot;
NATO: Oh, here we go again. &quot;An attack on one is an attack on all,&quot; right? We're your posse, aren't we?
Canada: Yeah, yeah. We'll back you up, as always.
France: Oh joy, more American bravado. Fine, count us in too.
Germany: Alright, alright, let's not get too carried away with the cowboy act.
USA: Ha, you know how I roll. So, I invade Afghanistan, saying it's about Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Operation Enduring Freedom, they called it. Just a little regime change, no biggie.
Afghanistan: Hold on a second! You stormed in here, disrupted everything, and now you're acting like the hero?
USA: Oops, sorry not sorry. We had some issues to sort out.
Iraq: Oh, you don't even remember me, huh? You thought I had weapons of mass destruction, which I didn't. And you invaded me, leading to chaos and destruction.
USA: My bad, blame it on bad intelligence. But hey, we brought you democracy!
International Community: Seriously, USA? Your interventions are causing more problems than they're solving. Torture, civilian casualties, and insurgencies everywhere!
USA: Yeah, well, you know how it is. We got a little carried away. But don't worry, we're all about freedom and justice.
Pakistan: Uh, excuse me, but you were doing secret drone strikes in my territory without telling me. Not cool.
USA: Gotta do what I gotta do, right? Besides, I had to find that Osama bin Laden guy.
World: Ugh, typical. Unilateral actions, questionable tactics, and then claiming to be the savior. We're tired of this.
USA: Hey, we got him in the end, didn't we? A bit of waterboarding and some torture, and we got the info we needed.
World: Seriously? You're bragging about that?
USA: Well, you know, desperate times and all that.
Afghanistan: And while you're busy patting yourself on the back, don't forget you left us in ruins. Rebuilding, anyone?
USA: Yeah, yeah, we'll get to it eventually. Don't rush us.
World: Look, let's not glorify this mess. It's time to clean up and find more peaceful ways to address conflicts.
USA: Alright, alright, fine. We'll try to be a bit more diplomatic, I guess.
World: Raise a half-hearted toast to hoping for better decisions in the future.

            <Text>
We have a silly lie where I come from. We believe the cold makes us tough instilling in us a resilience as enduring as the permafrost and a work ethic like the steadfast pines under snow.

It doesn’t, really. 

It’s a gentle deception, a lullaby, an anthem.

All lies are intended to make us feel more comfortable and safe. We drape it around our shoulders against a bitter cold.

Lies are tender guardians, they cradle you in a familiar embrace. I hope you find your roots there, flourish and thrive, nurtured in the soil of what you know.
That you believe in.
Truth on the other hand, truth is a traveling companion. One who teases you with a letter from a foreign country, one that whispers from beyond the threshold of the known, where the soul ventures forth in search of something more profound than the lulling serenity of the familiar.
It is the voice of the sea, a shout big a strong, screaming and screaming. And the thing it is screaming is, yoooou... with shit instead of brains... life is immense... can you understand that? 
The truth may travel it may even grow, but it is unchanging.
I’ve often thought about the balance of these two forces in our lives – like watching the northern lights that your Morfor so dearly wanted to see, a mesmerizing dance of light and darkness. 
Lies and truths. We learn, we grow, and we find solace in knowing that both have their rightful place in the vast landscape of our existence.
Like anything in life it depends on your perspective And that's where you have your own superpowers. 
For many people that flag represented Peace. Good people who had hope in their hearts and a kind of humble optimism that they were earnestly bursting to share with the world. 
But I never saw that in my lifetime. [switch camera angles]
The mythology we inherit depends on which side you’re on.
Even though I was not there to watch you grow, know that you have always been in my heart, a constant presence that no border could ever diminish.  


============================================================


They will raise you to think like them to love it there.

They will tell you to worship that flag in school

But you don't have to. In my view. You are not one of them
You have a choice and you are part of a different community
The human community.

You are welcome here. 

From my perspective you were stolen from that community. And you are always welcome back. But you have to fight for that yourself. And against the psychotic selfishness of that place that stole you from me.

It's all about perspective. And that's where you have your own superpowers. 

For many people that flag represented Peace. Good people who had hope in their hearts and a kind of humble optimism that they were earnestly bursting to share with the world. 

But I never saw that in my lifetime.
Like anything in life it depends on your perspective
And perspective always depends on which side you’re on [switch camera angles]

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font of
their house. This PDF file was generated via Scrivener's compile
feature and was created from the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all
caps about halfway down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word
from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).

         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                 Chapter Two

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert
&gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you may wish to have the
word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit
&gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest 100--this
feature is used on the title page of this manuscript, in fact).

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Synopsis>You hear there was a shooting and you might be sad. But it's already done. It's basically statistics at this point it's in the past we should move on.  But I imagine how easy or hard it might have been to change that outcome. Where it that change might have taken place and weigh the odds of that and the effort against what was lost.  The lives that could have been lived together. the children that we might have watched grow up. The burden grows with each branch we trance into it's veiny possibilities.  

The unclaimed memories weigh on the Heart.

I spend too much time there but it always teaches me the same thing. It's better to fight for the good memories that could be and the people who might live than to settle for the comfort of quickly managed grief.</Synopsis>

            <Synopsis>
I want to write to Jenica

Dear narcissist,

It's time to acknowledge what is going on here.  I know it won't maken a difference in the substance of our communication but I will be less of a burden on me to stop pretending that you are anything other than someone who acts out of your own short term interest.

It is no comfort to me to accept that one day Colette will navigate around you the way most adults who truly understand you navigate around you.  With a mixture of love and pity, but without trust or the ability to truly connect with you. Because to connect with someone you have to be able to emphasize with them and you simply can't do that.  One day Colette will grow to love you the way you love your mother.  The biological requirement of love will always work against the sense of reluctance and resentment that you feel.

It's no comfort knowing that, being older parents this phase where Colette realizes what you did to her will last for a minority of your life.  You won't truly have to experience the impact of her understanding what you are.  In fact, because of what you've done I'll miss the majority of her life, no matter what I do.

You've done this.  You knew that my greatest fear before becoming a parent was that I would be working too much to be a part my child's life.  I adjusted so much of my life to be a significant part of my future child's life even before meeting you, and somehow you managed to make it so that I will see my daughter less than I saw my father.

Somehow you managed to recreate the same distant and strained relationship you have with your father.</Synopsis>

            <Text>I used to love war.  In my imagination jet fighters would crak open the perfect summer skies at a lake called Cache lake. 
I would spend nearly half the summer place where my family has been going for four generations.

The lakes in souther Ontario aren’t blue like the ones in the Rockies, they are black, deep lakes that make a puzzle of the hilly land.  


The lake plays tricks on you, such as when you’re swimming beneath deep water and look down to see a light emanating from the empty bottom.  Like a whispy green sun buried barely uner the unseen mud on the lake bottom.
You want so badly to chase that light, touch the bottom.  As you dive into the thermocline and cold water permeates panick into you and you feel the sunlight squinting in the deeper water.  Your goggles start to press into your eyes uncomforably and you pull them down to your neck.  You pause to squeeze your nose and equalize the pressure in your ears. You want that bottom and you pull it towards you with a few strong strokes.  Then it you hit it. Your perogee.  You can’t go any further.  Your body has done the math, and your desire for that green light has been outmatched by the squeezaing need for air and the feeling of the distance that separates you from breath.  But the fear of emptyness still consumes you when you leave the lake.  You so badly want to touch something where the the limits of your body and the word leave you with nothing.

I used to wake up every morning dreading talking to Jenica.  &quot;I want less of you (Jenica)&quot;. Are the words that immediately pop into my head each time I realize where I am.

Now the first words that in awake to are &quot;Im tired of this&quot;. Or &quot; this is not my life&quot;. Every morning it hits me like a punch to the gut.

My face is changing. I've gotten so old so quickly after being the guy who looked younger than he is.  I've gained weight. One by one my clothes no longer fit.

It's amazing how long you can deny something is happening when you're still fighting it.  This part of my life lasted from 13 April 2021 till now (8th July 2023).  Wow.  Two years of feeling like this.

These should have been the happiest, most wonderful times of my life.

#Colette 
#GraphicNovel 

Is there a way to tell this story without breaking your heart?

I can't be there with you whether you need me or not.  But at least I can stop myself from putting anything out there that will make you feel pain.  It's the ony option I've been given to be a good part of your life. 

When I was a teenager I was put on anti-depressants briefly.  The Dr,  Dr. Muzuka asked me what my initial impression of the drugs were.

I didn't feel sad anymore.  The river of sorrow that seemed to soak into everything in my life and made it just shit was gone.  But in its place was nothing.  I felt nothing.  I realized that even the sorrow and sadness somehow helped me feel connected to the world.  If that was all I felt, at lest I FELT it. My experience of life, happy or sad, was better as an experience.  

I wonder what you will choose, if you will reflect on this choice I made to write it all out.  Will you be content to feel or will you wish you had never turned these pages?  

I find in life, with time, we seldomly regret our experience, it becomes us.  And if we are even remotely happy we are glad for that exprience, the good and the bad ones.  

It doesn't really matter how I feel about it now, because one day that will change.  And then I won't remember my life before all this.  And just for that reason I will love even this sorrow that formed who I am.  This uncessary, abusurd and abundant sorrow.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>Dear Judge Rubin,

I am writing this letter in wholehearted support of Stephan DuVal in his ongoing child custody case. My name is George Skzypniak, and I have had the privilege of calling Stephan one of my closest friends since our high school days. Over the decades, our bond has only deepened, and I can speak with confidence about the character and qualities of Stephan.

Knowing Stephan for such a long duration has given me numerous opportunities to observe and appreciate his dependability and dedication. Among the many friends and acquaintances from our high school years, Stephan stands out as one of the most solid and reliable individuals I've known. He has an innate sense of doing what's morally right, often going out of his way, even if the path isn't the easiest.

Throughout our years of friendship, Stephan has been a pillar of support for me, especially during the early days of my startup business. His assistance in various projects, irrespective of their complexity or demand, speaks volumes of his commitment and loyalty.
One of the things that I've always admired about Stephan is his desire and preparedness to start a family. The passion and excitement with which he approached the prospect of fatherhood were evident. He read extensively, saved, and planned to provide the best for his child. It's heart-wrenching to witness the challenges he's faced, especially considering how earnestly he had embraced the dream of fatherhood.

I distinctly remember the day when I first heard Colette's voice over the phone. The moment she called Stephan &quot;dada&quot; was incredibly touching. It was evident, even from that brief interaction, how much she loved Stephan and the bond they shared. Last summer, I had the chance to see them together, and their connection was palpable.

Based on my personal experiences and observations, I believe that Colette will immensely benefit from having Stephan in her life. He is not just a reliable friend to me but a loving and dedicated father to his daughter. The stability, love, and care that he offers are unparalleled, and I sincerely hope that Colette gets the opportunity to grow up with her father's continued presence and influence.

Should you have any further questions or require additional insights into my experiences with Stephan, please do not hesitate to reach out.
Yours sincerely,

George Skzypniak

            <Synopsis>

When Jenica and I started planning to have Colette I told her that my greatest fear was to be working so much that I never got to spend meaningful time with my children.  I even changed careers and took a massive pay cut so that I could work from home and be closer to Colette during her young years.

Now I don't make enough to simply spend the time that I want to in the USA.  The more time I spend and the cost of travel and hotels make it impossible financially to spend time with Colette and support her financially. 

It's a form of torture to have to work a job don't like you chose to have more time with your child and not be able to see them.  There is a border and an interactable financial problem that prevents me from being a part of Colette's life.  To send what little money I make to raise a child that I'm prevented from seeing is a kind of slavery.


Even in the tech world Americans love slavery. If you have an HB-1 visa it's tied to your job.  Lose your job and you have to leave the country in 60 days.  Americans love the idea of your existence being tied to your productivity.</Synopsis>

            <Text>Sometimes when I think of being stopped at the border I think of the checkpoints the Americans would set up in Iraq.  In the chaos of that war they would divide up that country an separate families from each other.

Sometimes these checkpoints were difficult to make out given the language barrier and the rush of it all.  Families. Whole familes would turn a corner and come upon these barricades only to be met by jumpy soldiers with powerful rounds who would turn their cannons on these cars. Families, whole families of fathers, mothers and children of all ages died in these moments. Again and again.
And these men and women came home. They were called brave, they were called heroes and thanked for their service.  
These are your neighbours.</Text>

            <Title>Needing a Hug</Title>
            <Synopsis>
I wanted you to have a good life. Even in this place.  After your mom showed no interest in the business I built for her it became apparent that the only way we could move out if the one bedroom house that her parents gave her the downpayment for was to find a good job .
I chose programming because it paid well and there was a chance I could do it from home and watch you grow up from there. But most importantly it was hard.  So there was less of a chance that someone could jump in and take my job from me. That's important.

I dreamed that you would have your own bedroom and you could have a live in a nice house like your uncle Andy and Erica's kids do. Maybe you could even have an in the ground pool like the one your mom grew up with.

I worked hard. And for a moment it looked like I could do it.  Before I got serious, I built a little circuit that could detect the voltage of film equipment and a program that ran on an android phone that could show you the information. It was proof I could do this and I could hold it in my hands.

I started into the basics of computer science and you would pop your little head around the corner and giggle because you knew I would chase you.

Everything was going so well until your mom kicked me out.

Somehow your brother made it to six without knowing how to swim.  We got him lessons and she became hyper focused on getting you swimming.  I began teaching you french - when she cancelled the Green card she began to speak to you in broken German and Spanish.

Now she had taken an $18,000 loan from her parents to do a data science course.

I was devastated. I couldn't work or focus anymore.  I laid on the floor and cried.

I begged your mom to bring you to me. I begged her for a hug so I could feel some human kindness. She refused.

By August 2021 the food stamp agency called me to confirm how much money I was sending to support her.  It was on average $800 a month for that year.  She was living with her parents again - even though they said if she had another kid they would have to ask her to move into her own place.  She was unemployed in the hottest job market and lowest unemployment in decades.

            <Synopsis>The precious little moments are escaping me now.  I forget what I’ve written down and what I’ve forgotten to make a note of.  I’ve been working through the pain of losing you so much that I’ve completely forgotten to take note of the joys.

When I moved into that house on River street that I shared with the student and a few people in their 20s who were working in hotels, delis, etc.  There weren’t many toys for you to play with, and the place was messy, especially the kitchen and the little parts of the floors that babies like to get into. 

But I noticed that someone who had lived there liked to put bouncy balls in baskets.  Those were a magnet for you.  You went right to them immediately.  They were the first things I cleaned and you would get me to pull one of the baskets down and you would pull each ball one by one and throw it across the room.  You loved that and so did I.  

The way you curled your lip when you saw me.  I think you were imitating a face I used to make, but for a while, even when I left for Canada you would do that every time you saw me.  We both loved that game.  

You have an amazing memory.  You even rememer books that I have forgotten.  I couldn’t remember what the Sleepy Alphabet Book was, that you kept asking for at story time.  But tonight as I was at my parents I found it.  We had read it before.  It took seeing the title for me to remember it, but you asked for it by name. 

I love the way you saw grandma and remembered the Pyjamas she had sent you.  I know she loved hearing you say thank you. These little moments are like summer rain. 

Chasing you.  Throughout the day at Jenica’s house you would pop your little head around the corner and giggle- you were less than one.  You didn’t have any words, but you knew how to make the game start.  And I would chase you.  I would chase you all around the house and you would craw as fast as you could until I caught up and you exploded into giggles.  If everything else in my life dissolved into nothingness and all I had was that memory, I wouldn’t miss the rest.  

I remember taking you to the coffee shops.  I was so proud of you.  Russel Peters has a bit about how white guys hold their beer at parties high and close to their chest, like they had won a prize.  I felt the same with you.  I carried you everywhere. And I was so proud of you.  We would go to the coffee shop and I would read the paper with you and explain to you what I was reading.  We would have croissants and you would make a mess.  I would always ask you what you liked and talk to you about what we were doing.  I loved it.  I left you explore a little because you were walking by the summer of 2022.  You never seemed to bother anyone.  I was proud of you.  I’m always proud of you.  

Thats all for now.  It is all starting to feel heavy.  The memories, or the pushing away increasingly present negative thoughts.  I’m just having trouble writing more.  I would give anything for more rain, so it didn’t feel like I was holding on to the remaning drops from last summer.</Synopsis>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose either of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.

Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “All files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.

Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>
