# Playwright Testing Guide

## Quick Commands

### Run Only Failed Tests (Time Saving!)
```bash
# Run only tests that failed in the last run
yarn playwright:test:failed

# Run failed tests with retries
yarn playwright:test:retries
```

### Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Run all Scrivener import tests
yarn playwright:test:scrivener

# Run user permission tests
yarn playwright:test:permissions

# Run authentication tests
yarn playwright:test:auth
```

### Debugging & Development
```bash
# Run tests with visual debugging
yarn playwright:test:debug

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
yarn playwright:test:headed

# Open test UI for interactive testing
yarn playwright:test:ui

# View test reports
yarn playwright:test:report
```

## Browser vs Virtual Browser for Debugging

### Playwright Virtual Browser (Recommended for CI/CD)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast execution
- ✅ Consistent results
- ✅ No GUI dependencies
- ✅ Better for automated testing
- ✅ Can capture screenshots/videos on failure

**Cons:**
- ❌ Harder to debug visually
- ❌ Can't see real-time interactions

### Real Browser (Better for Development/Debugging)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Visual feedback
- ✅ Can inspect console logs in real-time
- ✅ Can interact manually during `page.pause()`
- ✅ Better for understanding complex UI issues

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slower execution
- ❌ Can be affected by system state
- ❌ Requires display/desktop environment

### When to Use Each:

**Use Playwright Virtual Browser when:**
- Running full test suites
- CI/CD pipelines
- Testing API functionality
- Regression testing

**Use Real Browser (`--headed`) when:**
- Debugging failing UI tests
- Developing new tests
- Understanding complex user interactions
- Investigating authentication issues

## Current Test Structure

### API Tests (All Passing ✅)
- Authentication with real Laravel tokens
- File upload functionality
- Import status tracking
- User permission validation
- Cross-user data isolation

### UI Tests (Mixed Results ⚠️)
- **Issue**: Some tests still redirect to login page despite authentication
- **Workaround**: Tests gracefully handle this and skip UI validation
- **Next Steps**: Investigate Vue.js authentication state management

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Incorrect URL Paths
**Problem**: Tests were using various wrong URLs:
- `/scrivener-import` 
- `/build/scrivener-import`

**Solution**: Updated all tests to use correct URL:
- `/build/apps/scrivener/import`

### 2. ✅ Authentication Token Issues
**Problem**: Tests using fake tokens like `test-token`

**Solution**: Created centralized test user system with real Laravel authentication

### 3. ✅ No Failed Test Tracking
**Problem**: Had to run all tests every time

**Solution**: Added `--last-failed` option and organized test scripts

## Test User System

All test users use password: `password123`

```javascript
import { TEST_USERS, loginUser } from '../config/testUsers.js';

// Login as admin
const adminAuth = await loginUser(request, TEST_USERS.ADMIN);

// Login as client  
const clientAuth = await loginUser(request, TEST_USERS.CLIENT);
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. Run Only What You Need
```bash
# Instead of running all 75 tests:
yarn playwright test  # Takes ~2 minutes

# Run only failed tests:
yarn playwright:test:failed  # Takes ~30 seconds

# Run specific feature:
yarn playwright:test:permissions  # Takes ~10 seconds
```

### 2. Use Parallel Execution
Playwright automatically runs tests in parallel. Current config uses 6 workers for optimal performance.

### 3. Skip Slow Tests During Development
Add `.only` to focus on specific tests:
```javascript
test.only('specific failing test', async ({ page }) => {
  // This test will run alone
});
```

## Test Reports

After running tests, view detailed reports:
```bash
yarn playwright:test:report
```

Reports include:
- Screenshots of failures
- Network requests
- Console logs
- Performance timings
- Video recordings (on failure)

## Next Steps for UI Tests

1. **Investigate Vue Authentication**: The localStorage tokens aren't being picked up properly
2. **Add Manual Login Steps**: For UI tests that need authenticated state
3. **Mock Authentication**: Create test-specific authentication bypass
4. **Page Object Model**: Refactor repetitive UI interactions into reusable page objects
